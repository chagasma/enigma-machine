# Enigma Machine

A simple implementation of the Enigma machine cipher in C.

This program simulates the basic Enigma encryption mechanism using three rotors (I, II, III), a reflector, and the double-stepping feature. It encrypts text character by character using rotor positions that change with each input.

## How to Run

Compile the program:
```
gcc main.c -o main
```

Run the executable:
```
./main
```

Enter text to encrypt. The program will output the encrypted result.
